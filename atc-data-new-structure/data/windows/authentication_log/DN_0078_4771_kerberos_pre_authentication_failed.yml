title: Kerberos pre-authentication failed
description: >
  This event generates every time the Key Distribution Center fails 
  to issue a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This can occur 
  when a domain controller doesn’t have a certificate installed for 
  smart card authentication (for example, with a "Domain Controller" 
  or "Domain Controller Authentication" template), the user’s password 
  has expired, or the wrong password was provided. This event 
  generates only on domain controllers
