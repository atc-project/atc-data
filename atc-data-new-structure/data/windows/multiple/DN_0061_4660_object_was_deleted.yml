title: An object was deleted
description: >
  This event generates when an object was deleted. The object could be a 
  file system, kernel, or registry object. This event generates only if 
  "Delete" auditing is set in object’s SACL. This event doesn’t contain 
  the name of the deleted object (only the Handle ID). It is better to 
  use "4663(S): An attempt was made to access an object" with DELETE 
  access to track object deletion. The advantage of this event is that 
  it’s generated only during real delete operations. In contrast, 
  "4663(S): An attempt was made to access an object" also generates 
  during other actions, such as object renaming
