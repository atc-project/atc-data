  Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations determines whether the operating 
  system generates security audit events for Kerberos service ticket requests.
  Events are generated every time Kerberos is used to authenticate a user who 
  wants to access a protected network resource. Kerberos service ticket 
  operation audit events can be used to track user activity

  - 4769 # (S, F): A Kerberos service ticket was requested
