description: >
  Module logging records pipeline execution details as PowerShell executes, 
  including variable initialization and command invocations. 
  Module logging will record portions of scripts, some de-obfuscated code, 
  and some data formatted for output. 
  This logging will capture some details missed by other PowerShell logging sources, 
  though it may not reliably capture the commands executed

  Manual steps to implement logging policy:

  Computer Configuration > 
  Administrative Templates > 
  Windows PowerShell >

  Enabling via registry key:
  ```
  reg add "hklm\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ModuleLogging" /v EnableModuleLogging /t REG_DWORD /d 1
  reg add "hklm\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ModuleLogging\ModuleNames" /v "*" /t REG_SZ /d "*"
