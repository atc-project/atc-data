  Audit Process Creation determines whether the operating 
  system generates audit events when a process is created (starts). 
  These audit events can help you track user activity and understand 
  how a computer is being used. Information includes the name of the 
  program or the user that created the process.
eventID: 
  - 4688 # (S): A new process has been created
  - 4696 # (S): A primary token was assigned to process
