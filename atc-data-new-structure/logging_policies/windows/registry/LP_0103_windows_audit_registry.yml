  Audit Registry allows you to audit attempts to access registry objects. 
  A security audit event is generated only for objects that have system access 
  control lists (SACLs) specified, and only if the type of access requested, such 
  as Read, Write, or Modify, and the account making the request match the 
  settings in the SACL.
  If success auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any account 
  successfully accesses a registry object that has a matching SACL. If failure auditing 
  is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any user unsuccessfully attempts 
  to access a registry object that has a matching SACL
