  The process creation event provides extended information 
  about a newly created process. The full command line provides 
  context on the process execution. The ProcessGUID field is a 
  unique value for this process across a domain to make event 
  correlation easier. The hash is a full hash of the file with 
  the algorithms in the HashType field.

configuration: |
  Sysmon Event ID 1 is enabled by default, however only the SHA1 hashing algorithm is included in the HashType.
  Sysmon config to enable MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and imphash algorithms:
  ```
  <Sysmon schemaversion="4.00">
    <HashAlgorithms>md5,sha1,sha256,imphash</HashAlgorithms>
  </Sysmon>
  ```
