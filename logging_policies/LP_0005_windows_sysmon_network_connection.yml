  The network connection event logs TCP/UDP connections on the machine.

  through the ProcessId and ProcessGUID fields. The event also contains 
  the source and destination host names IP addresses, port numbers and IPv6 status.

configuration: |
  Sysmon Event ID 3 is disabled by default and can be enabled by specifying a configuration file.  
  However, it should be noted that this Event ID can produce a high volume of logs and as such filtering these connections may be valuable to organisations.
