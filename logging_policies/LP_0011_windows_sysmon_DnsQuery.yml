author: '@atc_project'
default: Not configured
volume: High
description: This event is generated when a process executes a DNS query, whether the result is successful or fails, cached or not. The telemetry for this event was added for Windows 8.1 so it is not available on Windows 7 and earlier.
eventID: 
  - 22

configuration: |
  Sysmon Event ID 22 is disabled by default and can be enabled by specifying a configuration file.  
  Due to the volume of events that DNS queries generate, some orgs may want to remove this section from their configuration to reduce Sysmon log turnover.

  DNS logging is a very nuanced challenge in monitoring due to event volume. Legitimate domains can be used to host malware/C2, but lookup itself is not very informative.
  It's fine to exclude monitoring these bulk low-value lookups, but at same time, you would not have a full log of how malware communicated, potentially missing C2.
  This section of Sysmon configuration will require your full judgement and knowledge of your org's priorities. There is no correct answer.

  Sample configuration:
  ```
  <DnsQuery onmatch="exclude">
  </DnsQuery>
  ```
